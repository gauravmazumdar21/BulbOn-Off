# Bulb On-Off

1. index.html
This is the main HTML file of the website. It defines the structure and content of the web page. It includes the following elements:

A table containing an image of a bulb, an on/off button, and a description.
The <script> tag at the end of the file links to the JavaScript file script.js.
2. script.js
The JavaScript file contains a function handleEvent() that is responsible for changing the state of the light bulb when the "On/Off" button is clicked. When the button is clicked, it toggles the bulb image between on and off, changes the button text, and updates the button's background color accordingly.

The CSS file defines the styling for the website. It sets the background color and styling for the "On/Off" button and ensures that the content is centered within the table cells.
